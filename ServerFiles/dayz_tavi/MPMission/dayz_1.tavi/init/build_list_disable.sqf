Build list by Daimyo Client side
Add and remove recipes, Objects(classnames), requirments to build, and town restrictions + extras
This method is used because we are referencing magazines from player inventory as buildables.
Main DEFAULT array (_buildlist) consist of 34 arrays within. These arrays contains parameters for player_build.sqf
From left to right, each array contains 1st: [Recipe Array], 2nd: "Classname", [3rd: Requirements array]. 
Check comments below for more info on parameters
